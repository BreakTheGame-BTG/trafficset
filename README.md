# trafficset
Simple and easy to use script, that allows you to adjust traffic and ped amount. For setting the traffic and ped amount, just play with *cl.lua*.

Installation: drag and drop in your *resource* folder, add *start trafficset* to *server.cfg* , and you're done. Enjoy!

Credits to *Chocoleight* for creating the script.
