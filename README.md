# trafficset
Simple and easy to use script, that allows you to adjust traffic and ped amount. For setting the traffic and ped amount, just play with cl.lua.

Instalation: drag and drop in your resource folder, remove the "-master" from "trafficset-master", add "start trafficset" to server.cfg, and youre done. Enjoy!
Credits to *Chocoleight* for creating the script.
